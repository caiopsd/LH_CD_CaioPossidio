# LH_CD_CaioPossidio

This project is designed to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and prediction using machine learning. 
The main goal is to analyze data and build a regression model for predicting a target variable.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook file (`EDA_and_Prediction.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
   ```
   jupyter notebook EDA.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform data preprocessing, EDA, and model training.
3. Adjust the code as needed to fit your specific dataset or use case.

## Requirements

The required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
